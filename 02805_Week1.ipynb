    "Using [this slightly biased source](http://www.json.org/xml.html) the following can be said in the XML/JSON debate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the excitement around XML is around a new role as an interchangeable data serialization format. XML provides two enormous advantages as a data representation language:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Extensibility** - JSON is not extensible because it does not need to be. JSON is not a document markup language, so it is not necessary to define new tags or attributes to represent data in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interoperability** - JSON has the same interoperability potential as XML.\n",
