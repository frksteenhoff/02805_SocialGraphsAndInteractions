    "Dispersion (spredning) of a network is $\\sigma_k = k^\\frac{1}{2}$, where $k$ is the number of people a person typically knows in a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of friends a typical individual has is $k \\pm \\sigma_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  in a random society all individuals are expected to have a comparable number of friends. Hence if people are randomly connected to each other, we lack outliers: There are no highly popular individuals, and no one is left behind, having only a few friends. This suprising conclusion is a consequence of an important property of random networks: *in a large random network the degree of most nodes is in the narrow vicinity of $k$*,\n",
    "\n",
    "**Small facts**\n",
    "\n",
    "* In a random network the chance of observing a hub decreases faster than exponentially.\n",
    "* The random network model underestimates the size and the frequency of the high degree nodes, as well as the number of low degree nodes. Instead *the random network model predicts a larger number of nodes in the vicinity of ‹k› than seen in real networks*.\n",
    "* Small p, absence of giant component, when p reaches a critical value it suddely emerges.\n",
    "* We have a giant component iff each node on average has more than one link.\n",
    "* Largest component at $k < 1 = ln(N)$,\n",
    "* Largest component at $k = 1 = N^\\frac{2}{3}$,\n",
    "* All nodes should join the giant component for $k > ln(N)$ (most are under this threshold),\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evolution of random networks**,\n",
    "Two extreme cases are easy to understand:,\n",
    "\n",
    "$N$ = size of entire network.\n",
    "\n",
    "$N_G$ = largest connected cluster within the network, that varies with $k$ (number of aquaintances),\n",
    "\n",
    "$p$ =\n",
    "\n",
    "* For $p = 0$ we have $k = 0$, hence all nodes are isolated. Therefore the largest component has size $N_G = 1$ and $\\frac{N_G}{N}\\rightarrow 0$ for large $N$.\n",
    "* For $p = 1$ we have $k= N-1$, hence the network is a complete graph and all nodes belong to a single component. Therefore $N_G = N$ and $\\frac{N_G}{N} = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The different regimes **,\n",
    "\n",
    "*Subcritical regime*,\n",
    "> In summary, in the subcritical regime the network consists of numerous tiny components, whose size follows the exponential distribution (3.35). Hence these components have comparable sizes, *lacking a clear winner that we could designate as a giant component*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Critical point*,\n",
    "> The critical point separates the regime where there is not yet a giant component ($k ‹ 1$) from the regime where there is one ($k › 1$). In summary, at the critical point most nodes are located in numerous small components, whose size distribution follows (3.36). The power law form indicates that components of rather different sizes coexist. These numerous small components are mainly trees, while the giant component may contain loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Supercritical regime*,\n",
    "> This regime has the **most relevance to real systems**, as for the first time we have a giant component that looks like a network. *In the supercritical regime numerous isolated components coexist with the giant component*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Connected regime*,\n",
    "> For sufficiently large $p$ the giant component absorbs all nodes and components, hence $N_G$≃$N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Overall*,\n",
    "> In summary, the random network model predicts that the emergence of a network is not a smooth, gradual process: The isolated nodes and tiny components observed for small ‹k› collapse into a giant component through a phase transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Network evolution graph theory**,\n",
    "\n",
    "At $z = 1$ trees of all orders are present, together with cycles of all orders. Complete subgraphs of order 4 appear at $z =\\frac{-2}{3}$, and as $z$ increases further, complete subgraphs of larger and larger order emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predictions of random netowrks with importance to real networks**,\n",
    "* Once the average degree exceeds $k = 1$, a giant component should emerge that contains a finite fraction of all nodes. Hence only for $k › 1$ the nodes organize themselves into a recognizable network.\n",
    "* For $k › ln(N)$ all components are absorbed by the giant component, resulting in a single connected network,\n",
    "* Real networks extravagantly exceed the $k = 1$ threshold. *The average degree of real networks is well beyond $k = 1$, they all have a giant component*,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** Small world phenomenon/six degrees of separation**,\n",

    "*Explanation of short distances*,\n",
    "\n",
    "A node in a network with average degree $k$ has,\n",
    "* $k$ nodes at dist = 1,\n",
    "* $k^2$ nodes at dist = 2,\n",

    "\n",
    "*small world phenomenon*\n",
    "> we mean that the average path length or the diameter depends logarithmically on the system size. Hence, “small” means that $d$ is proportional to $ln(N)$, rather than N or some power of $N$\n",
    "\n",
    "> The \\fec{1}{ln(k)} term implies that the denser the network, the smaller is the distance between the nodes,\n",
